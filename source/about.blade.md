I'm a web application developer and the founder of [Savvy Wombat](https://savvywombat.com.au).

Before starting my own business, I spent several years as the lead for a team of in-house developers, building
websites and web-based applications for [Australian Medicines Handbook](https://www.amh.net.au). I have been developing
PHP solutions since 2002, and have used a variety of frameworks over the years. I have also written software in C++ 
(using the Qt Framework), and have experience with front end development using JavaScript, and also been involved in
user interface/experience design.

Currently I'm focusing on the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework as the foundation for future work.

During my tenure as Team Lead, I started looking into project management, resulting in adopting 
[agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/) practices, and worked to bring various project stakeholders and the development 
closer together, improving communication and shortening development time.

When I'm not working, I'll be travelling, spending time with family, reading, painting, 
or knocking something together out in the workshop. But I probably won't blog about any of that.
