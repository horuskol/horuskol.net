# It begins

(again)

![phoenix rising](/assets/images/phoenix.svg)

This blog is being resurrected after a long break.

The motivation for this has been partly because I wanted to give myself more time and space to think about software 
development than I have before now.

I also wanted to have a place where I can share bits of code and solutions that I discover and develop as I build 
applications and websites.
